# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer: props stands for 'properties' and is used as an object or function call between the main object components and the child object components to allow for better structure within the App.js main folder and to have child components within the component files to be seperated and called upon from the main folder

  Researched answer: upon further research I did not mention that props come from state.  I see that in the parent component that props is identified, which allows for component calls to pass information from the parent to the child components.  Props are used like arguments within a function that allows for the data to be passed between the parent and child components. Props are only passed in one direction.



2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: a DOM event is how the eventlistener searches through the DOM library and handles the interactions between the user.  Developers can set specific events which then handles the user's interaction and allows for specific things to happen based on that interaction.  Utilizing the DOM events can help the developer to target the specific value or input for that interaction occurrence.  

  Researched answer: The Document Object Model is always listening for user input or interaction.  The events are what is occuring at the time and the changes that happen when the event is triggered.  These can be mouse clicks, hover over an item or image, or key strokes when inputing someting.



3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: OOP is a concept where everything is an object.  The programming takes on smaller parts of data and basically defines the functions as classes of an object in order for it to have specific attributes an behavior and to be repurposed.  Funcational programming is a specific designed function that performs it purpurpose and cannot be reused.  Functional programming can be rather long but produce the same result it was written for.

  Researched answer: OOP are containers of data that can be changed and tweeked without effecting the entire program.  The OOP objects allow for unique usage that can help with scalibility and efficiency.  Since OOP relies on classes and objects it is used as reusable pieces of code that helps to simplify the structure of programming and create individual instances of objets.



4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer: Integers in Ruby are whole numbers, such as 1, 2, 3, etc.  Floats are Ruby's way of idenctifying partial numbers, such as 1.2, .5, 3.8, etc.  They are both used to identify these specific types of numbers so Ruby an perfrom  and produce the results properly.

  Researched answer: Integer is the Ruby class for whole numbers and Float is the Ruby class for inexact real numbers.



5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: Ruby has the ability to return the last line without the need to use the 'return' command

  Researched answer: Ruby is set to return the last line of input.  Ruby will return the last executed instruction even if a return is not explicitly called.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Instance Variable: using the @ symbol before a variable string to set it to belong to the "instance" of a class. Now its content is restricted to whatever object itself refers to.

2. PostgreSQL: It is a powerful OOP, open source object-relational database system that uses and extends SQL. It has many features that helps developers build applications, protect data integrity, and helps to manage data.  

3. Ruby on Rails: It is an open source software used to build web applications.  It is a framework used to create websites using Ruby.

4. ORM: Object-relational mapping.  It is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible systems.  It is a tool that allows developers to write database (SQL) queries using Rails. You don't have to manually call the database, instead ORM handles it for your.

5. Active Record:  It is a Rails object-relational mapping that takes data which is stored in a database table and lets you interact with the data like a Ruby object. It provides an interface and binding between the tables in a relational database and the Ruby program code toat manipulates database records. Ruby method names are automatially generated from the field names of the database tables.
